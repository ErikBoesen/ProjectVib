        <p>Smartphones are powerful tools. With the device in our pocket, we can communicate with millions of people, take photos, and access nearly all the information known to man. But since the advent of these devices, people aren't getting closer. If anything, we're getting further apart.</p>
        <p>Smartphones aren't bad. The problem is that so much of what we use them for is just so... pointless. Do you really need to check Instagram five times in one hour? Have you ever watched all your friends' Snapchat stories and thought "Wow, that was really worth my time!"? Despite their pointlessness, they're addictive. But there is still something you can do.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Try the battery challenge.</strong> Try only charging your phone to 50% and living on that for the whole day. Alternately, try using one charge for two days (or twice however long one charge normally lasts).</li>
